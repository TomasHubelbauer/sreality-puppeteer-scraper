# Notes

## 2018-01-07

Ditched 3rd party request blocking - it was my connection / possibly Seznam throttling me, not ads, slowing me down.

Utilized Commander for parsing CLI options, it looks pretty good and helpful.

Working through paging and opening detail pages for each post.
Stuck at slow connection to SReality making it hard to debug.
Figured out how to auto-open DevTools and start maximized which is very nice.
Learnt about `waitForSelector` and flexed `$eval` which both rock.

## NodeJS `import`
